# Biosignal Pipelines

This repository contains modular pipelines for the analysis of EEG and ECG biosignals in both Python and R. The project supports data in CSV and EDF formats and provides a range of preprocessing, feature extraction, visualization, and machine learning tools for biosignal research and prototyping.

## Features
- Modular code structure for easy extension and maintenance
- Preprocessing: filtering, artifact removal, normalization, and more
- Feature extraction: time, frequency, nonlinear, HRV (for ECG), and connectivity (for EEG)
- Visualization: raw and processed signals, power spectra, HRV, and connectivity
- Machine learning: feature selection, model comparison, and explainability

## Usage
- Place your data files in the `data/` directory (CSV or EDF format)
- Use the scripts in `python/` or `R/` to run the pipeline or individual modules

## Requirements
- See the top of each script for required packages
